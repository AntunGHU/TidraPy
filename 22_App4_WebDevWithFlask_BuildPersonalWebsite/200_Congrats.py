# Hey, I just wanted to congratulate you and tell you that it's remarkable that you made it this far in the course. You have completed around 50% of the course, and I know it takes patience and commitment to go this far without quitting. Since you made it this far, you probably know a lot about Python by now. I promise that if you go on completing the rest of the course you will be on the right path to becoming a real Python programmer. There's a ton of fun and useful content and apps waiting for you in the next sections.

# Kudos and I'll keep in touch with you!
