You have completed around 50% of the course, and I know it takes patience and commitment to go this far without quitting. Since you made it this far, you probably know a lot about Python by now. I&nbsp;promise that if you go on completing the rest of the course you will be on the right path to becoming a real Python programmer. There's a ton of fun and useful content and apps waiting for you in the next sections.</p><p>Kudos and I'll keep in touch with you!</p><p>Ardit</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
